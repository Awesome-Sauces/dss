# DSS v0.1 (Dataset Standard)
## Overview:
The DSS v0.1 (Dataset Standard) is a format designed for storing data in JSON, catering to statistical and machine learning models. It aims to provide a unified structure that facilitates seamless data handling and interoperability across various AI applications.

## JSON Structure:
- The DSS v0.1 follows a hierarchical JSON structure, comprising the following key components:

- metadata: This section stores general information about the dataset, such as its name, description, creation date, and version.

- data: This section contains the actual data records. It is structured as an array of JSON objects, where each object represents a single data entry.

- features: This section defines the features or variables present in the dataset. Each feature has a name, data type, and optional metadata such as description and units.

- targets: If applicable, this section defines the target variables used for supervised learning tasks. Similar to features, each target has a name, data type, and optional metadata.

## Example:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "Iris Dataset",
    "description": "A famous dataset for classification tasks.",
    "version": "1.0",
    "created_at": "2023-08-01"
  },
  "features": [
    {
      "name": "sepal_length",
      "data_type": "numeric",
      "description": "Length of the sepal in centimeters",
      "units": "cm"
    },
    {
      "name": "sepal_width",
      "data_type": "numeric",
      "description": "Width of the sepal in centimeters",
      "units": "cm"
    },
    {
      "name": "petal_length",
      "data_type": "numeric",
      "description": "Length of the petal in centimeters",
      "units": "cm"
    },
    {
      "name": "petal_width",
      "data_type": "numeric",
      "description": "Width of the petal in centimeters",
      "units": "cm"
    }
  ],
  "targets": {
    "name": "species",
    "data_type": "categorical",
    "description": "The species of the iris flower",
    "classes": ["setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"]
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "sepal_length": 5.1,
      "sepal_width": 3.5,
      "petal_length": 1.4,
      "petal_width": 0.2,
      "species": "setosa"
    },
    {
      "sepal_length": 4.9,
      "sepal_width": 3.0,
      "petal_length": 1.4,
      "petal_width": 0.2,
      "species": "setosa"
    },
    {
      "sepal_length": 6.7,
      "sepal_width": 3.1,
      "petal_length": 5.6,
      "petal_width": 2.4,
      "species": "virginica"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
## Usage Guidelines:
- Dataset creators should adhere to the DSS v1.0 format when preparing data for statistical and machine learning models to ensure compatibility and ease of use.

- For new datasets, it is recommended to include relevant metadata, feature descriptions, and target information to enhance dataset understanding and usage.

- Data consumers, such as AI model developers, should verify the DSS version compatibility and utilize the provided feature and target information for appropriate model training and evaluation.

- Dataset managers and version control systems can use the **'metadata'** section to track dataset changes and maintain a historical record of dataset versions.

- It is encouraged to keep the dataset well-documented and regularly update the **'metadata'** section to ensure accurate and up-to-date dataset information.

The DSS v1.0 (Dataset Standard) strives to foster data accessibility, reusability, and reproducibility within the AI community, ultimately promoting more efficient development and deployment of statistical and machine learning models.
